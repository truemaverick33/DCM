# Docker Container Monitoring Tool  

This project is a comprehensive Docker monitoring application built with **PyQt6**, designed to provide real-time insights into Docker containers' performance, logs, and network activity. The tool is intuitive, interactive, and offers advanced visualization features to enhance container management and monitoring.

## Features  
- **Container Monitoring**: Tracks real-time CPU and memory usage for Docker containers with interactive graphs.  
- **Log Management**: Displays live logs for each container with automatic updates.  
- **Network Activity Analysis**: Captures Docker container network traffic and visualizes IP connections.  
- **Heatmaps**: Automatically generates IP connection heatmaps to highlight traffic intensity.  
- **Network Graphs**: Visualizes communication between containers and external devices.  
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Provides tab-based views, live updates, and customizable settings.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.9+  
- Docker installed and running  
- PyQt6  
- Additional Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `networkx`
